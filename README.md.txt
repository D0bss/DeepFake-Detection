# DeepFake Detection Tool 🎭🛡️

A graduation project featuring a deep learning–based tool designed to detect deepfake manipulations in facial media.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This tool leverages a trained **PyTorch** deep learning model to analyze facial content in images or videos and determine whether it has been altered using deepfake techniques. It offers an intuitive interface for uploading media, scanning for manipulated faces, and generating visual and textual reports.
